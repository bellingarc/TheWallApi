## For testing: Running it locally
Make a new directory on your system. Clone the repo to your directory using whatever method you prefer, by following the instructions at GitHub. After pulling the repo from GitHub, navigate via command line into the directory this repo is now housed. Now, using your package manager of choice, execute the command for dependency installation. With yarn this is 'yarn' and with npm this is 'npm i'
Now execute the command "npm test" or "yarn test" to activate the test runner in interactive watch mode.
